# data-structure-algorithms

This project is an amalgamation of the codebase practiced during the Scaler Program. 

I have taken this project with the intention to refresh my Data Structure and Algorithms concepts once again. 

Additional items to consider-
  1. This codebase is Open for review and feedback.
  2. Improvements done by self and enhancements done over a period of time.
  3. All the code is currently written using Java language.
